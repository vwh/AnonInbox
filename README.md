# Temp Mail Worker

Cloudflare Worker that acts as a temporary email inbox. It uses Hono for routing, and Cloudflare D1 for storing emails.

**Note**: This project serves as a starting point. While functional, there's a lot more that can be built on top of it!

### 1. Project Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary JavaScript dependencies.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Login to Cloudflare**: You need to log in to your Cloudflare account via Wrangler. This will open a browser for authentication.
    ```bash
    bun wrangler login
    ```

### 2. Cloudflare Configuration

#### a. D1 Database Setup

1.  **Create the D1 database**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:create
    ```
2.  **Copy the `database_id`**: From the output of the above command.
3.  **Update `wrangler.jsonc`**: Open `wrangler.jsonc` and replace `database_id` with the `database_id` you just copied.
4.  **Apply Database Schema**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:tables
    ```
5.  **Apply Database Indexes**:
    ```bash
    bun run db:indexes
    ```

#### b. KV Namespace Setup

1.  **Create the KV Namespace**:
    ```bash
    bun run kv:create
    ```
2.  **Copy the `id`**: From the output of the above command.
3.  **Update `wrangler.jsonc`**: Open `wrangler.jsonc` and add the `id` to the `kv_namespaces` binding for `EMAIL_STATS_KV`.

#### c. Email Routing Setup

1.  **Go to your Cloudflare Dashboard**: Select your domain (`example.com`).
2.  **Navigate to "Email" -> "Email Routing"**.
3.  **Enable Email Routing** if it's not already enabled.
4.  **Create a Catch-all Rule**:
    *   For "Action", choose "Send to Worker".
    *   Select your Worker (e.g., `temp-mail`).
    *   Click "Save".
